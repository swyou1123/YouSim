  // Rollup's path-resolution logic when handling re-exports can go wrong when wrapping pages which aren't at the root
  // level of the `pages` directory. This may be a bug, as it doesn't match the behavior described in the docs, but what
  // seems to happen is this:
  //
  //   - We try to wrap `pages/xyz/userPage.js`, which contains `export { helperFunc } from '../../utils/helper'`
  //   - Rollup converts '../../utils/helper' into an absolute path
  //   - We mark the helper module as external
  //   - Rollup then converts it back to a relative path, but relative to `pages/` rather than `pages/xyz/`. (This is
  //     the part which doesn't match the docs. They say that Rollup will use the common ancestor of all modules in the
  //     bundle as the basis for the relative path calculation, but both our temporary file and the page being wrapped
  //     live in `pages/xyz/`, and they're the only two files in the bundle, so `pages/xyz/`` should be used as the
  //     root. Unclear why it's not.)
  //   - As a result of the miscalculation, our proxy module will include `export { helperFunc } from '../utils/helper'`
  //     rather than the expected `export { helperFunc } from '../../utils/helper'`, thereby causing a build error in
  //     nextjs..
  //
  // It's not 100% clear why, but telling it not to do the conversion back from absolute to relative (by setting
  // `makeAbsoluteExternalsRelative` to `false`) seems to also prevent it from going from relative to absolute in the
  // first place, with the result that the path remains untouched (which is what we want.)
